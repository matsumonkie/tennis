SPA with Haskell/Elm

## Goal

Main goal is to learn more about Haskell and try to provide a good project architecture when building an API with Haskell.
Eventualy this project will try to provide:

  - an admin interface to operate CRUD operations like Active Admin does
  - a regular user interface to book tennis courts
 
## Tools/Languages/Frameworks

Nothing is definitely settled but for now I will go with:
 
  - API : Haskell with Servant
  - ORM : Opaleye (subject to change)
  - DB : Postgres (subject to change)
  - Front end : Elm (subject to change)
